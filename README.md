# hearmeROR

This R package comprises an automated system for monitoring the 
Roaring River Distribution System and alerting staff to changing 
conditions.

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. Sensitive information and
development history have been removed but I have kept the underlying
infrastructure as a learning tool/reference/example. This package will
function provided you update the mail host and recipient information
in the [templates](inst/templates).
